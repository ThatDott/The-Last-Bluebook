# The Last Bluebook

**The Last Bluebook** is an arcade-style  avoidance game where you play as the bluebook in the final exam of the final semester. Collect correct answers and dodge flying grades to survive. Score at least 60% to pass – or face the dreaded **Singko** (failing grade)!

This game is inspired by the **University exam experience in the Philippines**, complete with **Pinoy meme sound effects** and grade-based tension!
